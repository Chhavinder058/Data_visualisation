Similarly, the dependent variable is represented by the 'price' column of the dataset. Labeling the data is a fundamental step in any supervised machine learning model, thus essential for the random forest regression analysis.\n","\n","- Two empty lists were created to store the Mean Absolute Error and OOB score obtained during different iterations of the model run.\n","\n","- A for loop is utilized to execute the model 10 times, as per the instructions.\n","\n","- The data is divided into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio, represented by X_train, Y_train, X_test, and Y_test. This division is necessary to assess the accuracy of the model constructed on untrained data. The model is trained using 80% of the data (X_train and Y_train), while the remaining 20% (X_test and Y_test) is used for accuracy testing.\n","\n","- The RandomForestRegressor model is instantiated and stored in a variable named rf. In the parameters, the number of decision trees built is set to 100 using n_estimators, and all CPU cores are utilized to parallelize the training process, denoted by n_jobs=-1. This speeds up the training process. Additionally, oob_score is set to True to enable bootstrap sampling and calculate the out-of-bag (OOB) score for each iteration. Setting it to False would train the decision trees on the entire dataset instead of bootstrap samples, reducing the randomness and hence the generality of the model.\n","\n","- rf.fit(X_train, Y_train) trains the RandomForestRegressor model using the training data X_train and corresponding labels Y_train.\n","\n","- rf.predict(X_test) generates predictions for the dependent variable, which are stored in Y_predicted. These predictions are then compared with Y_test to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Similarly, rf.oob_score_ calculates the OOB score for the model. For each iteration, the MAE and OOB score are stored in the variables 'e' and 'oob', respectively. These values are then averaged, and the averages are displayed as the final output.\n","\n","- The MAE of $349 and OOB score of 0.820 indicate an improvement over the previous model trained on the raw dataset.
